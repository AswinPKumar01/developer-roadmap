> The goal of this project is to teach you how to build a real-time password strength analyzer using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. You will learn how to analyze a password’s strength by checking for length, character variety, and common patterns, while providing real-time feedback to the user.

In this project, you are required to build a **Password Strength Analyzer** that checks the strength of a password as the user types. The password strength will be evaluated based on factors like length, use of special characters, uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and the avoidance of common patterns like "password" or "1234".

### Key Requirements:

- **Password Length**: The analyzer should score passwords based on their length.
- **Character Variety**: Check if the password contains uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- **Pattern Detection**: Warn the user if the password contains common weak patterns (e.g., “1234”, “password”).
- **Real-time Feedback**: Display feedback to the user while they are typing their password.

#### Example Output:

- **Weak**: "password"
- **Strong**: "P@ssw0rd123!"

### Submission Checklist:

- HTML structure with an input field for the password.
- CSS to style the input field and feedback messages.
- JavaScript to analyze password strength in real-time and display feedback.
- Error handling for edge cases like very short passwords or empty input.

By completing this project, you'll gain hands-on experience with **JavaScript input handling**, **DOM manipulation**, and real-time feedback mechanisms. This will help you understand how to validate user input and provide useful feedback in real-time, a critical skill for frontend development.
